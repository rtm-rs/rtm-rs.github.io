Commands are used to make changes in your data. Every adapter provides its own command
specializations, that can use database-specific features.

Core commands include following types:

* `:create` - a command which inserts new tuples
* `:update` - a command which updates existing tuples
* `:delete` - a command which deletes existing tuples

## Working with commands

You can get a command object via `Relation#command` interface. All core command types are
supported by this method.

Assuming you have a users relation available:

### `:create` command example

``` ruby
# inserting a single tuple
create_user = users.command(:create)

create_user.call(name: "Jane")

# inserting a multiple tuples
create_user = users.command(:create, result: :many)

create_user.call([{ name: "Jane" }, { name: "John" }])
```

### `:update` command example

``` ruby
update_user = users.by_pk(1).command(:update)

update_user.call(name: "Jane Doe")
```

### `:delete` command example

``` ruby
delete_user = users.by_pk(1).command(:delete)

delete_user.call
```

## Using custom command types

You can define custom command types too. This is useful when the logic is complex and you prefer
to encapsulate it in a single class.

``` ruby
class MyCommand < ROM::SQL::Commands::Create
  relation :users
  register_as :my_command
  
  def execute(tuple)
    # do whatever you need
  end
end
```

When your command is available in the configured rom container, you can get it in the standard way:

``` ruby
my_command = users.command(:my_command)

my_command.call(name: "Jane")
```

## Commands vs Changesets

Commands are the underlying abstraction for making changes in your database, whereas changesets
should be treated as a more advanced abstraction, which provides additional data mapping functionality,
and support for associating data.

For consistency, you should consider using changesets instead of commands; however, if you're processing
larger amounts of data, and performance is a concern, you may want to use commands instead.

Here are benchmarks showing you roughly performance difference between the two:
