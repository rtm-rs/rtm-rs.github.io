title: Mappers

Mappers are used to process relation data, this may involve merging results from
multiple relations into nested data structures or instantiating custom objects.
Relations generate their mappers automatically for most common use cases, but
mappers are separated from relations, which means you can always define your own
mappers, whenever you have the need.

## Default relation mappers

Relations are configured to map automatically to plain hashes by default. When you're
using relations via repostories, they are configured to map to `ROM::Struct` by default,
and you can define custom struct namespace, if you want your own objects to be instantiated
instead.

Here's how default mapping looks like, assuming you have a users relation available:

``` ruby
class Users < ROM::Relation[:sql]
  schema(infer: true) do
    associations do
      has_many :tasks
    end
  end
end

users.by_pk(1).one
=> {:id=>1, :name=>"Jane"}

users.by_pk(1).combine(:tasks).one
=> {:id=>1, :name=>"Jane", :tasks=>[{:id=>1, :user_id=>1, :title=>"One"}, {:id=>2, :user_id=>1, :title=>"Two"}]}
```

## Using custom mappers

A mapper can be any object which responds to `#call`, which accepts a relation and
return an array with results back. This means a simple proc will be just fine:

``` ruby
user_name_mapper = -> users { users.pluck(:name) }

user_names = users >> user_name_mapper

user_names.to_a
=> ["Jane", "John"]
```

Typically though, custom mappers will be used in more complex cases, when the underlying database
doesn't provide enough functionality that's needed to get desired data structures. In such cases,
you can define mapper classes and configure mapping there.

``` ruby
require 'rom/transformer'

class MyMapper < ROM::Transformer
  relation :users
  register_as :my_mapper
  
  map_array do
    # define custom transformations here
  end
end
```

With a custom mapper configured, you can use `Relation#map_with` interface to send relation data
through your mapper:

``` ruby
users.map_with(:my_mapper).to_a
```

`ROM::Transformer` is powered by [transproc](https://github.com/solnic/transproc#transformer).
