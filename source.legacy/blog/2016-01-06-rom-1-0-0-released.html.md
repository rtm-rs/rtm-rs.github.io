We're happy to announce the first stable release of `rom` core gem. It took us
a little over a year to discover and implement the core interfaces that allow
building rom adapters and extensions. Since no significant changes had to be made
for many months and there are no outstanding issues - `rom 1.0.0` is now available.

Following gems have been updated and released:

- rom 1.0.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v100-2016-01-06)
- rom-support 1.0.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-support/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v100-2016-01-06)
- rom-mapper 0.3.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-mapper/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v030-2016-01-06)
- rom-model 0.2.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-model/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v020-2016-01-06)
- rom-rails 0.6.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-rails/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v060-2016-01-06)
- rom-sql 0.7.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-sql/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v070-2016-01-06)
- rom-repository 0.2.0 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-repository/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v020-2016-01-06)

## What Does This Release Mean?

This is a huge milestone even though it doesn't change a lot from the usage point
of view. Having a stable set of core interfaces will make it easier to develop
adapters and extensions and get them to a stable state, too. Up until now every
ROM release was huge, including lots of changes in many places, multiple gems
were released at the same time. These kind of releases are hard to manage and it's
also difficult to provide information about individual changes and improvements
without overwhelming current users and potential new users.

Now, with the stable rom core, we can focus on individual adapters and extensions.
Release them separately, and probably more often. It will also make it simpler
to explain and document changes and improvements.

## What Happens Next?

First of all, we're working on updating [rom-rb.org](http://rom-rb.org), which will
have [a new design](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets.org/issues/111) and content -
as the documentation is currently being rewritten. The initial set of docs was too
focused on shared, lower-level APIs, mixed with adapter-specific APIs, which was
confusing. New docs will focus on high-level guides specific to individual adapters,
so it will be much easier to understand how to use ROM in a specific context.

As far as individual gems go, here's a rough plan:

* [rom](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets)
  * Relation schema support that can be used by commands and for migrations
  * Shared database migration interfaces for all adapters
* [rom-sql](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-sql)
  * Improvements in the query DSL, especially when it comes to building
    complex joins. We're still using Sequel but that may be changed in the near future.
  * Support for prepared statements
  * Built-in types for relation schemas specific to individual databases
* [rom-repository](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-repository)
  * Support for commands
  * Setup interface, that would make it simple to quickly configure gateway
    connection and fetch data
  * Support for dry-data structs and values
* [rom-model](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-model)
  * `ActiveModel::Validations` will be replaced by [dry-validation](https://github.com/dryrb/dry-validation)
  * `ROM::Model::Attributes` will be deprecated in favor of dry-validation schemas
* [rom-rails](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-rails)
  * Rewrite on top of [dry-component](https://github.com/dryrb/dry-component)
  * `ROM::Model::Form` will be deprecated

Apart from these improvements, there will be smaller clean ups, refactorings and
performance tweaks.

The following adapters are looking for contributors and/or maintainers:

* [rom-rethinkdb](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-rethinkdb)
* [rom-influxdb](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-influxdb)
* [rom-mongo](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-mongo)
* [rom-redis](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-redis)
* [rom-neo4j](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-neo4j)
* [rom-json](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-json)
* [rom-csv](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-csv)
* [rom-git](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-git)
* [rom-http](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-http)
* [rom-event_store](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets-event_store)

Please get in touch if your're interested in helping out :)

## Towards rom 2.0, Stable Adapters and Repository

Further development of adapters and repository will very likely require changes
in some of the core public APIs. Expect an evolution though, not a revolution.
Some features will be introduced during 1.x.y upgrades, like relation schema, but
any public API change will require a major version bump since rom follows SemVer.
It's probably safe to assume this will happen later this year.

`rom` 2.0.0 will be a base for the first stable releases of individual adapters and
extensions. That's why it is so important to focus on other adapters, not just
`rom-sql`, to see what kind of improvements are needed and whether it's going to
break any public APIs.

## Providing Feedback And Reporting Issues

If you have found an issue or you're seeking help, there are number of ways you
can get in touch:

* Report [an issue](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets/issues) on GitHub, preferably
  in the issue tracker for the specific rom project. If you're not sure which one
  it is - don't worry and report it in the main rom issue tracker
* Post a message [on our forum](http://discourse.rom-rb.org)
* Ask for help in [the zulip channel](https://rom-rb.zulipchat.com)

If you've got feedback regarding documentation and/or the website, please report
an issue in [the rom-rb.org](https://github.com/taqtiqa/ramets.org/issues) repo.

## Thank You!

I'd like to use this opportunity to simply say "Thank You!" to everybody involved

by contributing bug fixes, adding features or making huge refactorings. There
are also many people who have been very helpful in the gitter channel, providing
support for others who were trying out ROM.

Really special thanks go to early adopters and contributors:

  other adapters and patches in multiple rom projects as well as helped promoting
  rom at local Ruby meetups AND by providing support in our gitter channel
