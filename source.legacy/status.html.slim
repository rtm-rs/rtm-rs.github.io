  # ROM Project Status

  The ROM ecosystem consists of the core rom gem along with rom-rails, for Rails
  integration, and various adapter gems.

  With so many projects, it can be difficult to keep up on the status of each
  one. Below is a break-down for each rom-related project, the current stable
  released version, and the build status for the main branch.
